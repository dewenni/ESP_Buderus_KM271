## what's new

### new alarm messages

with this release, the software also supports the last 4 alarm messages from the Logamatic.
The informations are from the messages (0x0300, 0x0307, 0x030e, 0x0315), and will be send with the MQTT topic: "/alarm/"

If the failure is still active, you will get a message in this format:
```
failure outdoor sensor (>> 16:31 -3 days)
```

If the failure is already gone, you will get a message in this format:
```
failure outdoor sensor (>> 16:31 -3 days | << 20:40 -2 days)
```
the language of the alarm texts are also depending on the language config Flag and are available in german and english.

### new set values

- ```/setvalue/hc1_holidays``` and ```/setvalue/hc2_holidays```
 Resolution: 1 day - Setting range: 0 - 99 days
 Note: This value is reduced by 1 every day by the controller.

- ```/setvalue/hc1_day_setpoint ``` and ```/setvalue/hc2_day_setpoint```
 Resolution: 0.5 °C - Range: 10 – 30 °C 
- ```/setvalue/hc1_night_setpoint``` and ```/setvalue/hc2_night_setpoint```
 Resolution: 0.5 °C - Range: 10 – 30 °C 
- ```/setvalue/hc1_holiday_setpoint``` and ```/setvalue/hc2_holiday_setpoint```

# v3.0.0

## what's new

🎉 this is a major update with a lot of cool new features! 🎉
The webUI was redesigned for a better availability and stability. It reacts faster and the resource problem could hopefully be solved.
There is also a completely new configuration section in the webUI, where you can configure all the settings.
Its also now possible to show heating circuit 1 and heating circuit 2 in parallel.

The OTA Library has changed from ArduinoOTA to AsyncElegantOTA. With that, there is also the possibility to update the Software without PlatformIO.  
In Future you can update the software with the `firmware.bin` files from the release section and upload this directly on the webUI.

To get access to the webUI, even when there is no valid WiFi configuration, there is a new "Setup-Mode".
The "Setup-Mode" starts automatically if the configuration is invalid or missing and can be activated manually.  
To enable it manually, press the Reset-Button on the ESP and click it again within 5 Seconds.
If the ESP goes into "Setup Mode", it will automatically create a own network access point with ssid 📶 `"ESP-Buderus-KM271"`  
After you are connected to this network, you can open the webUI on ip-address **"http://192.168.4.1"**

## changelog

- re-work of the webUI value Tables for better stability
- remove `credentials.h`
- remove configuration options in `config.h`
- add new possibility to configure everything in the webUI
- new "Setup-Mode" with fallback Access-Point
- remove Wiki and extend `README.md`

# v3.2.5

## what's new

After some feedback that v3.2.4 is not stable for some users, I have downgraded espressif32 platform from 6.4.0 (in v3.2.4) back to 5.4.0
To be honest, I am not sure if this will fix the problem, but we give it a try.

**>>Attention:<<**  
I have also updated the partition schema from "default" to "min_spiffs" because we are on the limit of the free flash space (4 MB).
With the default partition schema there was about 1,3 MB of flash space for the Program, and wit the new partition schema we will have 1,9 MB.
The new partition schema will only applied if you flash the new firmware by serial cable to your ESP. This is why there is no OTA file for this version!
Be aware that this will delete your settings!
But with v3.2.4 you are able to download the config.json in the Tool Section of the WebUI.

## changelog

- fix wrong temperature value in WebUI #51
- Wrong position in the telegram used for hc1_switch_on_temperature #61
- implement service interface via mqtt #60  
- implement additional setvalue for "switch on temperature / Aufschalttemperatur" #60  
- fix some typo in param.txt
- add new system info in WebUI for flash size usage
- bugfix #67
- add readJSONstring() to check if parameter is valid

# v3.3.0

## what's new

This Versions brings some new features 🎉

### Manual ip parameters
There is now the possibility to set manual ip parameters instead of DHCP Mode.  

<img src="Doc/ip-settings.png" alt="IP-Settings" width="50%">


### Web-Authentication
There also the possibility to activate a new web-authentication. If the option is enabled, you have to enter username and password.
To manually logout, you can click on the "Logout" button below the settings. This seems to work fine on Chrome Browsers, but unfortunately it seems not to work on Safari.  

<img src="Doc/authentication.png" alt="web-auth" width="50%">  


### HC Reduction Mode
Added the command for "reductin mode" of heating circuits as mqtt command and to the webUI
```
command:    heating circuit 1: reduction mode
topic:      {"setvalue/hk1_absenkungsart", setvalue/hc1_reduction_mode"}
payload:    Number 0..3 (Abschalt,Reduziert,Raumhalt,Aussenhalt) / {off,fixed,room,outdoors)

command:    heating circuit 2: reduction mode
topic:      {"setvalue/hk2_absenkungsart", setvalue/hc2_reduction_mode"}
payload:    Number 0..3 (Abschalt,Reduziert,Raumhalt,Aussenhalt) / {off,fixed,room,outdoors)
```
<img src="Doc/reductionmode.png" alt="Reduction-Mode" width="50%">

(control to change the reduction mode)

### optional oneWire Sensor
You can now configure additional OneWire Sensors. In the configuration you can setup one ore two sensors.
The Sensor value will shown on the Dashboard and will also be send by mqtt with Topic `sensor` and the name that you can configure.
If you only configure one sensor, it will be shown as a single control. If you enable both sensors, it will be shown in a combined control.

<img src="Doc/opt_sensor_dash2.png" alt="opt-sensor-dash2" width="40%">

(single control)

<img src="Doc/opt_sensor_dash1.png" alt="opt-sensor-dash1" width="40%">

(combined control)

<img src="Doc/opt_sensor_cfg.png" alt="opt-sensor-config" width="50%">

(settings)

### Debug Filter
there is a new filter function for debug messages. Debug messages are send via mqtt with topic `debug_message`.
With the filter function you can influence what messages are sent.
The filter must consist of 11 hex values separated by a `_`. You can use `XX` as a wildcard instead of a hex value.
Example: `08_15_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX` will send all messages that begins with 08_15_...
You can also disable and enable debug mode with the mqtt command `cmd/debug` and payload 0 or 1.

```
command:    debug function - on/off
topic:      {cmd/debug", cmd/debug"}
payload:    0/1

command:    debug function - set Filter
topic:      {cmd/setdebugflt", cmd/setdebugflt"}
payload:    11 hex values separated with "_" (example: 08_15_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX)

command:    debug function - get Filter
topic:      {cmd/getdebugflt", cmd/getdebugflt"}
payload:    none (return value at message topic)
```

> [!NOTE]
> Remember that there is also a new service interface since v3.2.5 to send any command you like to the Logamatic.
```
command:    Service interface - only for Experts - use at your own risk!!!
topic:      {cmd/service", cmd/service"}
payload:    8 hex values separated with "_" (example: 08_15_04_65_65_65_65_65)
```

## changelog

- add manual IP-parameters instead of DHCP #56
- add authentication in WebUI #49
- add new command "reduction mode" for mqtt and webUI
- add new debug filter function
- calculate summer/winter if Logamatic is in manual mode #47
- add OneWire support #2

## Assets

> [!IMPORTANT]   
> Please only use the OTA update if you have already flashed v3.2.5 to the Board via the serial cable to activate the larger partition scheme.
> If you want to update from a version <= 3.2.4 to this version, please flash it by cable.
> If you have already flashed the v3.2.5 by cable, then you can also use the OTA update.

# v3.4.0

## what's new

This Versions is all about messages and brings some great new features 🎉

### Messaging option - Pushover

There is now the possibility to get messages via Pushover. 
Depending on the parameter "Filter", you can define what kind of messages you want to receive.
In the settings you can find all necessary parameters to setup the client.

Each application, service, or utility that sends notifications through Pushover's API needs to have its own API token which uniquely identifies all of the API requests that it makes.
API tokens are free and can be registered through [Pushover website](https://pushover.net/apps/build).

<img src="./Doc/pushover.png" width="75%">

### WebUI-Logger

There is also a new log function with which you can record various messages depending on the filter and display them via the WebUI. This can be useful for your own debugging and also for the further development of the software.
You can also configure the logging function and the associated filter in the settings.

<img src="./Doc/logger.png" width="75%">


## changelog

- rework messaging function. mqtt publish function was replaced with a generic messaging function for further options.
- add messaging option for "Pushover" #31
- add WebUI-Logger #70
- bugfix for updating OneWire sensor values if not enabled
- remove mqtt message "info = {"burner":0,"pump":100,"ww_temp":57,"boiler_temp":38}"
- improve behavior for incoming mqtt messages without payload (this could lead to problems in the past)

## Assets

> [!IMPORTANT]   
> Please only use the OTA update if you have already flashed v3.2.5 or v3.3.1 to the Board via the serial cable to activate the larger partition scheme.
> If you want to update from a version <= 3.2.4 to this version, please flash it by cable.
> If you have already flashed the v3.2.5 or v3.3.1 by cable, then you can also use the OTA update.
