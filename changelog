----------------------------------------------------------------

# v1.1.0

## what's new
add Program Timer Information to the config values.

Each **program** has up to **42 switch points** (SP).  
Each switch point includes the **day**, **time** and **switch state** (on/off).

example for heating circuit 1:
```
HK1_Timer01 = SP01: Mo  05:30  (An)  | SP02: Mo  22:00  (Aus)  | SP03: Di  05:30  (An)  
HK1_Timer02 = SP04: Di  22:00  (Aus)  | SP05: Mi  05:30  (An)  | SP06: Mi  22:00  (Aus)  
HK1_Timer03 = SP07: Do  05:30  (An)  | SP08: Do  22:00  (Aus)  | SP09: Fr  05:30  (An)  
HK1_Timer04 = SP10: Fr  23:00  (Aus)  | SP11: Sa  06:30  (An)  | SP12: Sa  23:30  (Aus)  
HK1_Timer05 = SP13: So  07:00  (An)  | SP14: So  22:00  (Aus)  | SP15: frei  
HK1_Timer06 = SP16: frei | SP17: frei | SP18: frei  
HK1_Timer07 = SP19: frei | SP20: frei | SP21: frei 
HK1_Timer08 = SP22: frei | SP23: frei | SP24: frei  
HK1_Timer09 = SP25: frei | SP26: frei | SP27: frei  
HK1_Timer10 = SP28: frei | SP29: frei | SP30: frei  
HK1_Timer11 = SP31: frei | SP32: frei | SP33: frei  
HK1_Timer12 = SP34: frei | SP35: frei | SP36: frei  
HK1_Timer13 = SP37: frei | SP38: frei | SP39: frei  
HK1_Timer14 = SP40: frei | SP41: frei | SP42: frei  
```

# v1.2.1

## what's new

You can switch between german and english mqtt topics.  

There is a new config option in **[/include/config.h](https://github.com/dewenni/ESP_Buderus_KM271/blob/aa369b0bc6e71b8ec41ad1284f3467846cb56dcc/include/config.h)**
```
#define LANG                0           // 0=GERMAN / 1=ENGLISH
```

You can also change or add the used texts, by editing **[/include/language.h](https://github.com/dewenni/ESP_Buderus_KM271/blob/0439aeb246c99b3b6733f8a491dcddebd77829e8/include/language.h)**

With that, I hope you have all the flexibility to adapt this software for your needs and your smart home environment.

## changelog

- add multi language support

---

# v1.3.3

---

**:heavy_exclamation_mark: I have changed the linked tag of this release from v1.3.1 to v1.3.3 because the was a mistake in v1.3.1**

## what's new

### new alarm messages

with this release, the software also supports the last 4 alarm messages from the Logamatic.
The informations are from the messages (0x0300, 0x0307, 0x030e, 0x0315), and will be send with the MQTT topic: "/alarm/"

If the failure is still active, you will get a message in this format:
```
failure outdoor sensor (>> 16:31 -3 days)
```

If the failure is already gone, you will get a message in this format:
```
failure outdoor sensor (>> 16:31 -3 days | << 20:40 -2 days)
```
the language of the alarm texts are also depending on the language config Flag and are available in german and english.

### new set values

- ```/setvalue/hc1_holidays``` and ```/setvalue/hc2_holidays```
 Resolution: 1 day - Setting range: 0 - 99 days
 Note: This value is reduced by 1 every day by the controller.

- ```/setvalue/hc1_day_setpoint ``` and ```/setvalue/hc2_day_setpoint```
 Resolution: 0.5 °C - Range: 10 – 30 °C 
- ```/setvalue/hc1_night_setpoint``` and ```/setvalue/hc2_night_setpoint```
 Resolution: 0.5 °C - Range: 10 – 30 °C 
- ```/setvalue/hc1_holiday_setpoint``` and ```/setvalue/hc2_holiday_setpoint```
 Resolution: 0.5 °C - Range: 10 – 30 °C 

## changelog

- add alarm messages
- add new set values

# v1.3.4

As not every Logamatic Model seems to support the alarm messages, I have added a config flag to be able to disable this messages.

## changelog

- Alarm message configurable #8

# v3.0.0

## what's new

🎉 this is a major update with a lot of cool new features! 🎉
The webUI was redesigned for a better availability and stability. It reacts faster and the resource problem could hopefully be solved.
There is also a completely new configuration section in the webUI, where you can configure all the settings.
Its also now possible to show heating circuit 1 and heating circuit 2 in parallel.

The OTA Library has changed from ArduinoOTA to AsyncElegantOTA. With that, there is also the possibility to update the Software without PlatformIO.  
In Future you can update the software with the `firmware.bin` files from the release section and upload this directly on the webUI.

To get access to the webUI, even when there is no valid WiFi configuration, there is a new "Setup-Mode".
The "Setup-Mode" starts automatically if the configuration is invalid or missing and can be activated manually.  
To enable it manually, press the Reset-Button on the ESP and click it again within 5 Seconds.
If the ESP goes into "Setup Mode", it will automatically create a own network access point with ssid 📶 `"ESP-Buderus-KM271"`  
After you are connected to this network, you can open the webUI on ip-address **"http://192.168.4.1"**

## changelog

- re-work of the webUI value Tables for better stability
- remove `credentials.h`
- remove configuration options in `config.h`
- add new possibility to configure everything in the webUI
- new "Setup-Mode" with fallback Access-Point
- remove Wiki and extend `README.md`
