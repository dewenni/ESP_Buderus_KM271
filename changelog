## what's new

### new alarm messages

with this release, the software also supports the last 4 alarm messages from the Logamatic.
The informations are from the messages (0x0300, 0x0307, 0x030e, 0x0315), and will be send with the MQTT topic: "/alarm/"

If the failure is still active, you will get a message in this format:
```
failure outdoor sensor (>> 16:31 -3 days)
```

If the failure is already gone, you will get a message in this format:
```
failure outdoor sensor (>> 16:31 -3 days | << 20:40 -2 days)
```
the language of the alarm texts are also depending on the language config Flag and are available in german and english.

### new set values

- ```/setvalue/hc1_holidays``` and ```/setvalue/hc2_holidays```
 Resolution: 1 day - Setting range: 0 - 99 days
 Note: This value is reduced by 1 every day by the controller.

- ```/setvalue/hc1_day_setpoint ``` and ```/setvalue/hc2_day_setpoint```
 Resolution: 0.5 °C - Range: 10 – 30 °C 
- ```/setvalue/hc1_night_setpoint``` and ```/setvalue/hc2_night_setpoint```
 Resolution: 0.5 °C - Range: 10 – 30 °C 
- ```/setvalue/hc1_holiday_setpoint``` and ```/setvalue/hc2_holiday_setpoint```

# v3.0.0

## what's new

🎉 this is a major update with a lot of cool new features! 🎉
The webUI was redesigned for a better availability and stability. It reacts faster and the resource problem could hopefully be solved.
There is also a completely new configuration section in the webUI, where you can configure all the settings.
Its also now possible to show heating circuit 1 and heating circuit 2 in parallel.

The OTA Library has changed from ArduinoOTA to AsyncElegantOTA. With that, there is also the possibility to update the Software without PlatformIO.  
In Future you can update the software with the `firmware.bin` files from the release section and upload this directly on the webUI.

To get access to the webUI, even when there is no valid WiFi configuration, there is a new "Setup-Mode".
The "Setup-Mode" starts automatically if the configuration is invalid or missing and can be activated manually.  
To enable it manually, press the Reset-Button on the ESP and click it again within 5 Seconds.
If the ESP goes into "Setup Mode", it will automatically create a own network access point with ssid 📶 `"ESP-Buderus-KM271"`  
After you are connected to this network, you can open the webUI on ip-address **"http://192.168.4.1"**

## changelog

- re-work of the webUI value Tables for better stability
- remove `credentials.h`
- remove configuration options in `config.h`
- add new possibility to configure everything in the webUI
- new "Setup-Mode" with fallback Access-Point
- remove Wiki and extend `README.md`

# v3.2.5

## what's new

After some feedback that v3.2.4 is not stable for some users, I have downgraded espressif32 platform from 6.4.0 (in v3.2.4) back to 5.4.0
To be honest, I am not sure if this will fix the problem, but we give it a try.

**>>Attention:<<**  
I have also updated the partition schema from "default" to "min_spiffs" because we are on the limit of the free flash space (4 MB).
With the default partition schema there was about 1,3 MB of flash space for the Program, and wit the new partition schema we will have 1,9 MB.
The new partition schema will only applied if you flash the new firmware by serial cable to your ESP. This is why there is no OTA file for this version!
Be aware that this will delete your settings!
But with v3.2.4 you are able to download the config.json in the Tool Section of the WebUI.

## changelog

- fix wrong temperature value in WebUI #51
- Wrong position in the telegram used for hc1_switch_on_temperature #61
- implement service interface via mqtt #60  
- implement additional setvalue for "switch on temperature / Aufschalttemperatur" #60  
- fix some typo in param.txt
- add new system info in WebUI for flash size usage
- bugfix #67
- add EspStrUtil::readJSONstring() to check if parameter is valid

# v3.3.0

## what's new

This Versions brings some new features 🎉

### Manual ip parameters
There is now the possibility to set manual ip parameters instead of DHCP Mode.  

<img src="Doc/ip-settings.png" alt="IP-Settings" width="50%">


### Web-Authentication
There also the possibility to activate a new web-authentication. If the option is enabled, you have to enter username and password.
To manually logout, you can click on the "Logout" button below the settings. This seems to work fine on Chrome Browsers, but unfortunately it seems not to work on Safari.  

<img src="Doc/authentication.png" alt="web-auth" width="50%">  


### HC Reduction Mode
Added the command for "reductin mode" of heating circuits as mqtt command and to the webUI
```
command:    heating circuit 1: reduction mode
topic:      {"setvalue/hk1_absenkungsart", setvalue/hc1_reduction_mode"}
payload:    Number 0..3 (Abschalt,Reduziert,Raumhalt,Aussenhalt) / {off,fixed,room,outdoors)

command:    heating circuit 2: reduction mode
topic:      {"setvalue/hk2_absenkungsart", setvalue/hc2_reduction_mode"}
payload:    Number 0..3 (Abschalt,Reduziert,Raumhalt,Aussenhalt) / {off,fixed,room,outdoors)
```
<img src="Doc/reductionmode.png" alt="Reduction-Mode" width="50%">

(control to change the reduction mode)

### optional oneWire Sensor
You can now configure additional OneWire Sensors. In the configuration you can setup one ore two sensors.
The Sensor value will shown on the Dashboard and will also be send by mqtt with Topic `sensor` and the name that you can configure.
If you only configure one sensor, it will be shown as a single control. If you enable both sensors, it will be shown in a combined control.

<img src="Doc/opt_sensor_dash2.png" alt="opt-sensor-dash2" width="40%">

(single control)

<img src="Doc/opt_sensor_dash1.png" alt="opt-sensor-dash1" width="40%">

(combined control)

<img src="Doc/opt_sensor_cfg.png" alt="opt-sensor-config" width="50%">

(settings)

### Debug Filter
there is a new filter function for debug messages. Debug messages are send via mqtt with topic `debug_message`.
With the filter function you can influence what messages are sent.
The filter must consist of 11 hex values separated by a `_`. You can use `XX` as a wildcard instead of a hex value.
Example: `08_15_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX` will send all messages that begins with 08_15_...
You can also disable and enable debug mode with the mqtt command `cmd/debug` and payload 0 or 1.

```
command:    debug function - on/off
topic:      {cmd/debug", cmd/debug"}
payload:    0/1

command:    debug function - set Filter
topic:      {cmd/setdebugflt", cmd/setdebugflt"}
payload:    11 hex values separated with "_" (example: 08_15_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX)

command:    debug function - get Filter
topic:      {cmd/getdebugflt", cmd/getdebugflt"}
payload:    none (return value at message topic)
```

> [!NOTE]
> Remember that there is also a new service interface since v3.2.5 to send any command you like to the Logamatic.
```
command:    Service interface - only for Experts - use at your own risk!!!
topic:      {cmd/service", cmd/service"}
payload:    8 hex values separated with "_" (example: 08_15_04_65_65_65_65_65)
```

## changelog

- add manual IP-parameters instead of DHCP #56
- add authentication in WebUI #49
- add new command "reduction mode" for mqtt and webUI
- add new debug filter function
- calculate summer/winter if Logamatic is in manual mode #47
- add OneWire support #2

## Assets

> [!IMPORTANT]   
> Please only use the OTA update if you have already flashed v3.2.5 to the Board via the serial cable to activate the larger partition scheme.
> If you want to update from a version <= 3.2.4 to this version, please flash it by cable.
> If you have already flashed the v3.2.5 by cable, then you can also use the OTA update.

# v3.4.0

## what's new

This Versions is all about messages and brings some great new features 🎉

### Messaging option - Pushover

There is now the possibility to get messages via Pushover. 
Depending on the parameter "Filter", you can define what kind of messages you want to receive.
In the settings you can find all necessary parameters to setup the client.

Each application, service, or utility that sends notifications through Pushover's API needs to have its own API token which uniquely identifies all of the API requests that it makes.
API tokens are free and can be registered through [Pushover website](https://pushover.net/apps/build).

<img src="./Doc/pushover.png" width="75%">

### WebUI-Logger

There is also a new log function with which you can record various messages depending on the filter and display them via the WebUI. This can be useful for your own debugging and also for the further development of the software.

<img src="./Doc/logger.png" width="75%">


## changelog

- rework messaging function. mqtt publish function was replaced with a generic messaging function for further options.
- add messaging option for "Pushover" #31
- add WebUI-Logger #70
- bugfix for updating OneWire sensor values if not enabled
- remove mqtt message "info = {"burner":0,"pump":100,"ww_temp":57,"boiler_temp":38}"
- improve behavior for incoming mqtt messages without payload (this could lead to problems in the past)

## Assets

> [!IMPORTANT]   
> Please only use the OTA update if you have already flashed v3.2.5 or v3.3.1 to the Board via the serial cable to activate the larger partition scheme.
> If you want to update from a version <= 3.2.4 to this version, please flash it by cable.
> If you have already flashed the v3.2.5 or v3.3.1 by cable, then you can also use the OTA update.

### Telnet

In addition to the WebUI and MQTT, there is also a new Telnet interface to communicate with the ESP.
The interface offers several commands to read out information and send commands.
An overview of the commands can be called up using the "help" command.
To connect, a simple Telnet connection can be started via the corresponding IP address of the ESP.

Example: 
```
> telnet 192.168.178.135
```

# v4.1.0

## what's new

with this version comes the first implementation of mqtt discovery for Home Assistant 🎉

Unfortunately I have to do some breaking changes!


### Home Assistant mqtt auto Discovery

MQTT discovery for Home Assistant makes it easy to get all values in Home Assistant.
The Logamatic values will automatically visible as mqtt device in Home Assistant.
The config values and the status values are displayed. Some config values can also be changed as in the WebUI.
This is the first implementation, therefore lets see this an experimental state.
I am open for feedback and further improvements. Please use the issues and discussion section.

### BREAING CHANGES!!!

> [!IMPORTANT]   
> In the past, there were separate mqtt topics defined for the setvalues of the logamatic config values.
These topics were similar to the config Topics itself, but unfortunately there were some differences.
Now the setvalue topics are the same as the config topics.

some examples:
OLD: {"/setvalue/hk1_tag_soll", "/setvalue/hc1_day_setpoint"} => NEW {"/setvalue/HK1_Tagtemperatur", "/setvalue/hc1_day_temp"}
OLD: {"/setvalue/hk1_frost_ab", "/setvalue/hc1_frost_mode_threshold"} => NEW {"/setvalue/HK1_Frost_ab", "/setvalue/hc1_frost_protection_threshold"}
OLD: {"/setvalue/hk1_ferien_tage", "/setvalue/hc1_holidays"} => NEW {"/setvalue/HK1_Ferien_Tage", "/setvalue/hc1_holiday_days"}

To be more compatible, it is possible to use upper and lower case letters in the german setvalue topics.
It is also now possible to use the "string options" instead of num values as this is necessary for the home assistant integration. 

example:

- hc_operation_mode - payload: "day", "night", "auto"
- hc1_reduction_mode - payload: "off", "fixed", "room", "outdoors"
- hc_program - payload: "custom", "family", "early", "late", "AM", "PM", "noon", "single", "senior"

## changelog

- fix value of HC1_SwitchOffOptimizationTime, HC2_SwitchOffOptimizationTime, HW_SwitchOffOptimizationTime (was not set before)
- If there is a whitespace in optional sensor name, it will be replaced in the responding mqtt topic
- Fixes the saving of the hostname. This was previously saved incorrectly as wifi.ssid which made the WiFi settings unusable. #98

---

# v4.1.1

## what's new

some smaller changes and fixes


## changelog

## what's new

There are some changes to MQTT Discovery for Home Assistant

## changelog

- fixes the behavior that the devices are "not available" in Home Assistant, after Home Assistant has restarted. #108
- change control for "summer threshold" from Slider to DropDown
- add support to control "warm water pump circulation" at Home Assistant #110
- add restart button in Home Assistant

---

# v4.1.3

## what's new

There are some changes to MQTT Discovery for Home Assistant

> [!IMPORTANT]   
> with v4.1.2 the discovery config for "HK1_Sommer_ab", "hc1_summer_mode_threshold and "WW_Zirkulation", "ww_circulation" has changed.
> Therefore, it may be necessary to delete the old Discovery Config manually.
> This can be achieved by manually sending an MQTT message with the appropriate topic and an **empty** payload.
> Alternatively, with this version you can also reset all config messages via Telnet (ha resetconfig) and also resend the config via command (ha sendconfig)  
>
> Example for german Topics (payload empty):  
> `old Topic: homeassistant/number/Logamatic/HK1_Sommer_ab/config`  
> `old Topic: homeassistant/sensor/Logamatic/WW_Zirkulation/config`

## changelog

- bugfix Home Assistant setvalues not working - this bug was introduced in v4.1.2 #108
- add function to send MQTT discovery manually via Telnet (> ha sendconfig)
- add function to reset MQTT discovery manually via Telnet (> ha resetconfig)

# v4.1.4

## what's new

  only stability improvements

## changelog

- bugfix possible problems when connecting webUI clients. #116

---

# v5.0.0

## what's new

This is a major update with some new features and some redesign under the hood.
The Framework is updated to the new Arduino v3 based on ESP-IDF v5.1+
Several modifications have been made to achieve better performance and stability.

### Performance and stability improvements

Various improvements have been made to increase performance and stability. In particular, the communication between ESP and the web server has been redesigned and improved. The protocol was changed from SSE (Server-Sent-Events) to Websockets.
The maximum number of client connections is monitored and limited to the number of 2 active connections.


### Ethernet Support W5500

There is a new support for W5500 Ethernet Modules. This brings the possibility to use ethernet connection in parallel to WiFi connection.
This could be useful in situations where the WiFi connection is not available or stable.

For mor details, please have a look at the [documentation](https://github.com/dewenni/ESP_Buderus_KM271?tab=readme-ov-file#optional-ethernet-module-w5500) 


### Solar Support FM244

Support for optional Buderus Solar Module FM244 added. You can activate this in the same way as the heating circuits and hot-water.
Values are send by mqtt and are also available in the webUI.

### System Logger

The logging function has been extended. The mode can now also be switched to ‘System log’. In this case, the serial monitor is redirected to the log and you can see the messages that are normally only visible when you are connected via cable.

### new HC1/HC2 Control Elements

There are new HC1/HC2 control elements on the web UI

- HC1 Day Temperature / HC2 Day Temperature
- HC1 Night Temperature / HC2 Night Temperature
- HC1 Holiday Temperature / HC2 Holiday Temperature
- HC1 Switch-On Temperature / HC2 Switch-On Temperature

### additional Status Information in the web UI

There are some additional information in the status Tab of the web UI

- Status information about Ethernet connection
- Status information about KM271 connection
- Status information about MQTT connection

### BREAKING CHANGES!!!

> [!IMPORTANT]   
> In the past, there was a separate setting for the static IP. Now we have two possible interfaces and therefore the static IP setting is also duplicated and is located together with the WiFi and Ethernet settings. If you previously used static IP, you will need to adjust your settings.
>
>**I would recommend deactivating the static IP before the update!**

### Changed condition for Setup-Mode

Setup mode is now activated when the ESP is restarted **5** times.
A maximum of 5 seconds may elapse after each restart.

Example: restart 1/5 - wait 2s - restart 2/5 - wait 2s - restart 3/5 - wait 2s - restart 4/5 - wait 2s - restart /5/5 => Setup-Mode

### Extended Logger

The Logger source is now split into "System" and "Logamatic" log source.
System and Logamatic is recorded in parallel. You can switch between this two sources without deleting the buffer.
But the buffer will be deleted if you change the log filter for the Logamatic log.
